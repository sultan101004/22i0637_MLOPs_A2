## 🧪 Verification Commands

### Docker Compose Verification

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d --build

# Check status (all should be "healthy")
docker compose ps

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test signup
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'

# Test login and get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}' | jq -r .accessToken)

# Test protected endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/profile

# Frontend should be accessible
open http://localhost:3000

# Cleanup
docker compose down
```

### Kubernetes Verification

```bash
# Start Minikube
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192

# Build images
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t frontend:latest ./frontend
docker build -t backend:latest ./backend
docker build -t auth-service:latest ./auth-service

# Deploy
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Verify 3 replicas for each service
kubectl get pods -n microservices
# Should show:
# - 3 auth-service pods
# - 3 backend pods
# - 3 frontend pods
# - 1 postgres pod

# Check deployments show 3/3 ready
kubectl get deployments -n microservices

# Check services exist
kubectl get svc -n microservices

# Check PV/PVC
kubectl get pv,pvc -n microservices

# Get access URLs
MINIKUBE_IP=$(minikube ip)
echo "Frontend: http://$MINIKUBE_IP:30080"
echo "Auth: http://$MINIKUBE_IP:30001"
echo "Backend: http://$MINIKUBE_IP:30000"

# Test endpoints
curl http://$MINIKUBE_IP:30001/health
curl http://$MINIKUBE_IP:30000/health

# Run automated tests
./scripts/demo-test.sh kubernetes

# Cleanup
kubectl delete -f k8s/
minikube stop
```

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run complete test suite
./scripts/demo-test.sh docker     # For Docker Compose
./scripts/demo-test.sh kubernetes # For Kubernetes

# Should test:
# ✓ Service health checks
# ✓ Public endpoints
# ✓ User signup
# ✓ User login
# ✓ JWT token generation
# ✓ Protected endpoints (with/without token)
# ✓ Forgot password
# ✓ Reset password
```

### Manual Browser Testing

1. **Access Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 or http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:30080
2. **Sign Up**: Create new account
3. **Login**: Authenticate with credentials
4. **Dashboard**: View user profile data
5. **Logout**: Clear session
6. **Forgot Password**: Request reset token
7. **Reset Password**: Use token to reset

## 🎓 Instructor/TA Verification

To quickly verify this project:

1. **Clone and start**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run automated tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/demo-test.sh docker
   ```

3. **Check Kubernetes**:
